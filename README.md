# Permutations
Create permutations of strings from a dynamic array of array, taking a single element from each array. 

For running this program follow this steps(linux):
a] make input file at desktop which contains input data(input1.csv)
b] program file must be in same directory that is desktop(permutation.cpp)
c] then compile code, for this open terminal in same directory and run command: g++ permutation.cpp
d] output is generated in default file i.e. a.out
e] for seeing output run this command in terminal: ./a.out input1.csv
  then you will be able to see permutations of letters stored in input file.
